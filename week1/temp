Downloaded the precompiled RISC-V GNU toolchain archive:
riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz

Extracted the toolchain locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
tar -xvzf riscv-toolchain-rv32imac-x86_64-ubuntu.tar.gz
Located the riscv directory inside opt/, containing the complete toolchain (including bin/ folder).

Added toolchain to PATH by editing ~/.bashrc:

bash
Copy
Edit
export PATH=$HOME/Downloads/opt/riscv/bin:$PATH
source ~/.bashrc
Verified installation by confirming availability and correct functioning of:

riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc

riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump

riscv32-unknown-elf-gdb

Resolved missing shared library issue for gdb by installing the required Python 3.10 runtime.
